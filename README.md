# Online Multiplayer Lobby system fully built from scratch with Google Firebase and Unity
- Demo video link: https://youtu.be/I-NIRiEGtoU
## Features:
- Friend System: You can search for players with their names and send friend requests. They may accept or reject friend requests. If they approve a friend request, both of you will be friends and can invite each other to the lobby. In the backend, it uses Firebase to store the database of the players.
- Online Presence: When you are online you will be shown "idle" to your friends. When you're offline you will be shown "offline" to your friends. When you're in the lobby or in the match, you will be shown accordingly to your friends.
- Lobby System: You can send invitations to your idle friend. They may accept or reject the invitation. If accepted, they will be joined in your lobby.
- Host Migration: If you're the host of the lobby and you leave the lobby, the host will be migrated to a random player in the lobby.
